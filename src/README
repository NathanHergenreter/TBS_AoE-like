Run with ./game. Game is a turn-based strategy game. Arrow keys and space are the primary keys, escape is used to leave a game. New Game is the only functioning option in the main menu. In the new game menu, a map, player civilizations and colors, and player types can be selected. There is no AI, so CPU is completely non-functioning. The player manipulates their entities (units and buildings) to fight, build, recruit, research, etc. A player wins when their opponent has lost all of their entities.
